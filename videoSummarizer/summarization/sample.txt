Hi, I'm Emerald Robinson in this what is video Explorer cells cells are the smallest structural and functional unit of all living organisms. All cells have a cell membrane which controls the flow of substances out of the cell ribosomes which makes proteins necessary for all cell functions DNA. The genetic instructions to cell needs to make protein and cytoplasm the watery substance that contains all the cells structures some cells like bacteria or individual self-replicating independent life forms called unicellular organisms or single-celled organisms other cells are part of multicellular organisms such as us humans and collectively carry out specialized functions to keep that organism alive. How many different kinds of cells that exist can be divided into two main categories prokaryotes and eukaryotes prokaryote cells lack a nucleus bacteria are the best known and most studied for my prokaryotic organisms are recently discovered a second group of prokaryotes called archaea. Also exists doesn't do have nuclei are classified as eukaryotes. This includes fungus plant and animal cells as well as some unicellular organisms besides the nucleus the other significant difference between prokaryotes and eukaryotes is that eukaryotic cells contain specialized structures called organelles in which specific life-sustaining activities take place for the cell the major organelles that exist include the Golgi apparatus which sword package process and modify proteins mitochondria, which are the energy provider for the cells vacuoles the storage units found in some Cell the nucleus which controls all activities in the cell and the endoplasmic reticulum, which serves mini General functions plant cells also have chloroplasts responsible for photosynthesis as sunlight. Most cells are too small to be seen without the aid of a microscope. There are however exceptions. For example, the nerve cell of a giant squid can be 39 ft long. for thousands of how to advise videos on any topic visit monkey si.com
